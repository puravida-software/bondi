description: Use project opam switch when running OCaml commands
alwaysApply: true

# Opam Switch

This project uses a dedicated opam switch: **bondi**.

When running opam or dune commands (e.g. in terminal, builds, tests), ensure the correct switch is active:

```bash
# Activate the project switch
eval $(opam env --switch bondi)

# Or set it as default for the current shell
opam switch set bondi
```

Before running `just build`, `just test`, or any `dune` / `opam` commands, run the above if the switch might not be active.
